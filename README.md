# ZenMove-1.0

This project was used for coordinating the sequence of material movements to and from production lines in a manufacturing setting.

Some elements of the program don't work, as they depend on connections to longer exist. 

I will be revisiting this project to break up the modules into separate classes for a more intelligible reading of the code and renaming UserForms to add clarity.
