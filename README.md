# ZenMove-1.0

This project was used for coordinating the sequence of material movements to and from production lines in a manufacturing setting.

Some elements of the program don't work, as they depend on connections that no longer exist. 

I will be revisiting this project to break up the modules into separate classes for a more intelligible reading of the code and renaming UserForms to add clarity.

Use the Custom UI Editor for Microsoft Office to access the XML files that provides the cutomized ribbon menu buttons for accessing the user forms and code functions. It is found here: https://bettersolutions.com/vba/ribbon/custom-ui-editor.htm
